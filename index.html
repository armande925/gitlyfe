    <body>Are you frustrated with coding in slow motion</body>
    <p>Often times when creating an html file, you come to a point that you struggle with 
        with finding the flow of writing your code. In this tutorial I will walk you through 
        the process known as <strong>"code flow"</strong>, which will enable you to enter a 
        state of <em>zen-link</em> being. During this state, code will flow forth as if triggered
        by your thoughts and transmitted to the your text editor
